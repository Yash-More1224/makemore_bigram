# Implementing Character Level Bigram Model

Model predicts next character in a name depending on the previous character.

This prediction is based on probabilities of next-character when the previous character is known.

These probabilities are learnt from the training dataset, which consists of around 32,000 names.

(The project is inspired from Andrej Karpathy's YouTube series on Neural Networks)
